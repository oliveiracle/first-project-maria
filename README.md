## Features

### Existing Features

-   **Responsive Navigation Bar** [Screenshot of the mobile menu open](documentation/screenshots/m1.png)
    -   A fixed top navigation bar that adapts across devices. On mobile, it becomes a hamburger menu. It includes links to all main pages and a ‚ÄúBook Your Program‚Äù button.


-   **The Hero Section** [Screenshot of the homepage](documentation/screenshots/home.png)
    -   The homepage greets the user with a full-screen, high-quality background image and the brand's main tagline, "Quiet Luxury. Deep Presence." This creates an immediate sense of calm and luxury, setting the tone for the entire experience.
    -   *This feature's value is to instantly communicate the brand's identity and capture the user's interest.*


-   **Programs Page** [Screenshot of the programs page](documentation/screenshots/programs.png)

    -   *This provides a direct and easy way for potential clients to communicate with the spa.*


-   **The Footer**  ![Screenshot of the footer ](documentation/footer.png)
    -   The footer is consistent across all pages and contains the spa's address and links to its social media profiles. All external links open in a new tab.
