## UX

#### Design Approach
The visual and user experience aims to reflect the spa's values: calm, exclusivity, and minimalism. I used:
- A neutral color palette with soft contrasts.
- Large, clear fonts for easy reading.
- Simple navigation that stays the same on every page.
- A layout that adjusts smoothly on mobile and desktop.
- Clean sections with space to let each element "breathe".

#### User Stories
A set of user stories was created to shape the design and structure of the website, focusing on usability, consistency, and user experience.

-   As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the spa's concept from the homepage and have the site work perfectly on my device (desktop or mobile), so I can efficiently decide if this service is for me.
-   As a customer who values the story behind a brand, I want to read about the spa's philosophy and history, so that I can connect more deeply with its values.
-   As a potential customer with questions, I want to easily find the spa's contact information, including a form and a map, so that I can have my questions answered.
-   As a user, I want the navigation menu to be consistent and predictable across all pages, so that I can move through the site efficiently without getting lost.
-   As a potential customer, I want to see a gallery of high-quality photos of the spa's facilities, so that I can get a better sense of the atmosphere and environment.
-   As a user with a visual or motor impairment, I want the site to be built with accessibility in mind, so that I can navigate and consume the content without barriers.
-   As a customer, I want to find links to the spa's social media accounts, so that I can follow the brand for updates and inspiration.

## Design Choices

#### Color Scheme
The main colors used throughout the site include:

-   `#333333`: A deep charcoal used for text and primary elements, evoking seriousness and modern elegance.
-   `#ffffff`: Clean white used for backgrounds and containers to keep the design light and minimal.
-   `#cccccc`: Soft gray used for subtle hover effects and secondary tones.
-   Transparent overlays and subtle shadows are used to create a sense of depth without clutter.

#### Typography
Two carefully chosen fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) enhance the brand's visual identity:
-   **Cormorant Garamond:** Used for headings and brand name, this serif font conveys elegance, heritage, and a touch of old-world refinement.
-   **Raleway:** Used for body text and navigation, this sans-serif font adds a modern and clean contrast, ensuring readability and balance.

#### Icons & Imagery
-   **Icons:** The project uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (v6.7.2) for all icons. This includes icons for social media links in the footer and conceptual icons on the homepage that represent brand pillars like science, expertise, and holistic treatments. A custom favicon was also implemented to enhance brand recognition.
-   **Images:** All background and content images were carefully selected to align with the brand's minimalist and natural aesthetic, using soft lighting and neutral tones to create a serene and luxurious atmosphere.

## Wireframes
*(This section should be updated with images of the wireframes.)*

I created wireframes before starting development to plan the structure. Some of them will be updated to match the final version of the site, since I made several design improvements along the way.
