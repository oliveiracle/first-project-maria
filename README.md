# MARIA | Wellness & Spa

MARIA | Wellness & Spa is a static front-end website designed for a conceptual high-end spa brand focused on the ethos of "Quiet Luxury. Deep Presence." The site is targeted toward individuals seeking a serene, minimalist, and exclusive wellness experience.

The primary goal is to create a digital sanctuary that reflects the brand's core values, providing an intuitive platform to explore the spa's philosophy, browse its curated treatments, and easily get in touch. The entire user experience is crafted to be calm, elegant, and professional.

### Features Left to Implement

-   **Interactive Brand Pillars**
    -   Based on user feedback, a future version could make the four homepage icons clickable, scrolling down to new sections that expand on each concept. This would increase user engagement and provide more in-depth information on the landing page.
