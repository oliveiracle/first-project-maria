## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

## UX Design

### Colour Palette
I chose a very simple color palette to bring the 'Quiet Luxury' theme to life. By sticking to soft whites, deep grays, and black, the goal was to create a calm and elegant space for the user. I avoided any bright colors to keep the focus on the content and maintain a serene feel.
                                                                                    
- **Charcoal:** Used for primary text, headers, and footers for high contrast.
- **Medium Gray:** Used for secondary body text to be softer on the eyes.
- **Off-White & Pure White:** Used for backgrounds and highlighted text to create a clean, serene canvas.

### Typography
For the fonts, I wanted to create a nice contrast. I used:

- **Cormorant Garamond:** for the main titles to give the site that elegant, high-end personality.
- **Raleway:** for paragraphs, buttons, and menus. It's a really clean and simple font, which makes all the information comfortable and easy to read on any screen.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for both desktop and mobile to plan the layout and user flow before building the site.

## Features

### Existing Features

-   **Responsive Navigation Bar** 
   ![Screenshot of the mobile menu open](documentation/screenshots/mobile-menu-open.png)
    -  The navigation bar is designed for an intuitive Browse experience. It stays fixed at the top for easy access and seamlessly transforms into a clean hamburger menu on mobile. This ensures users can find what they need‚Äîfrom treatment pages to the ‚ÄúBook Your Program‚Äù button‚Äîfrom anywhere on the site, on any device.

-   **The Hero Section** 
   ![Screenshot of the homepage](documentation/screenshots/home.png)
    -   The first thing visitors see is a stunning, full-screen hero image paired with the brand's motto: "Quiet Luxury. Deep Presence." This serves as an immediate immersion into the spa's serene and high-end atmosphere, designed to capture attention and set a calm tone for the entire visit.

-   **Programs Page** 
   ![Screenshot of the programs page](documentation/screenshots/programs.png)
    -   Visitors can explore the spa's offerings on a visually-driven Programs page. Each treatment is presented in a clean "card" with a beautiful image and clear description, making it enjoyable for potential clients to browse and find a service that resonates with them. The grid layout is fully responsive.

-   **Contact Page**
   ![Screenshot of the contact page](documentation/screenshots/contact.png)
    -   Getting in touch is made easy. The Contact Page features a straightforward inquiry form and an embedded Google Map to help clients find the spa's location. It uses the Formspree service to handle form submissions, ensuring inquiries are reliably sent to the site owner's email.

-   **The Footer**  
   ![Screenshot of the footer ](documentation/footer.png)
    -   A clean footer is present on every page, providing easy access to the spa's address and social media profiles. This allows users to connect with the brand on other platforms or find key information at any point in their journey without interrupting their experience.

### Features Left to Implement

-   **Clickable Brand Pillars**
    -   In a future version, the four icons on the homepage could be interactive, revealing more content about each brand value when clicked or hovered.

## Testing

### Manual Testing
A comprehensive testing plan was followed to ensure the site is functional, visually polished, and accessible across different devices.

- All links were tested to ensure they go to the correct destinations.
- The contact form was tested with both valid and invalid inputs.
- External links were checked to open in a new tab.
- The layout was tested on different screen sizes using Chrome DevTools.
- Interactive elements like buttons and menus were tested for proper behavior.

### Validator Testing

-   **HTML**
    -   No errors were returned when passing the code for all three pages through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
     -  ![Index HTML Validator Results](documentation/html-validation/index.png)
     -  ![Contact HTML Validator Results](documentation/html-validation/contact.png)
     -  ![Programs HTML Validator Results](documentation/html-validation/programs.png)
    
-   **CSS**
    -   No errors were found when passing the `style.css` file through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
    -   ![CSS Validator Results](documentation/css-validation/css.png)

-   **Accessibility**
    -   The website achieved a perfect score of 100/100 in the Lighthouse accessibility audit, demonstrating its commitment to being usable by all users.

    -   ![Lighthouse Accessibility Score of 100 - Home Mobile Page](documentation/lighthouse/home-mobile.png) 

-   **Unfied Bugs**
-   - **Minor Visual Issue on Tall Mobile Screens:** On very tall and narrow viewports (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra), if the page content on the homepage is shorter than the screen height, a small white bar may be visible below the footer. This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect site functionality or structural integrity. The decision was made to acknowledge it as a known issue for a future update, prioritizing the stability of the current layout over a complex CSS change that could introduce further issues.
